    "Text summarization is the process of condensing a large amount of text into a shorter version while preserving its main ideas and key points. It's often used to extract the most important information from lengthy documents. There are two main types: extractive, which selects and combines existing sentences, and abstractive, which generates new sentences to represent the content. Example: Summarizing a news article to a few sentences highlighting the main story."

    "Object detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. It not only recognizes objects but also provides their precise positions. For instance, in an image containing a car, a person, and a tree, object detection would identify and outline each of these objects. Example Image: A photo with bounding boxes around detected objects like cars and pedestrians."

Unlike object detection, segmentation provides pixel-level accuracy by assigning each pixel in the image to a particular class or object. Example Image: An image where each object (e.g., a cat, a dog, and the background) is labeled with different colors or masks."
